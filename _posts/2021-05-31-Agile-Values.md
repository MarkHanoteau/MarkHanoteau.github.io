Agile is a mindset that puts people first. It unleashes your employees' potential in order to benefit your customers. This is unlikely to be done by squeezing more work out of your team members but instead by creating an environment of participative leadership that autonomously removes sources of waste, dysfunctions and impediments to business value. 

Paramount to achieving these outcomes is the endorsement of the four values and twelve principles captured in the Agile Manifesto. These propositions are not just applicable to sofware and hold true if you interchange the word software with whichever term (e.g. product, service) you find most relevant for your sector. The essence of the Manifesto outlines how to improve our collaborative ways of working in an ever changing world.  
 
So how can you help your team really tick and be succesful? The Agile Manifesto states:

> .. We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:  

> .. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools  
> .. Working software over comprehensive documentation  
> .. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation  
> .. Responding to change over following a plan  

> .. That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

The last sentence is key: you should not overlook the right side of the statement. You'll still enable your work through proccesses and accelerate it using tools. You'll still need acute documentation. You absolutely still want to do plenty of plannning. Individuals and interactions, working software, customer centricity and responding to change are just valued more. 

In case the values don't serve as sufficient food for thought, they are backed up by 12 principles. The tabs below break each value down and list which principles I believe most underpin each value. You may find other principles that support specific values. I'd love to hear your thoughts so reach out to me if you do.

**Individuals and interactions over processes and tools** looks to foster an environment of genuine commitment over compliance. It doesn't let teams wrap themselves around a tool. It favors openness and transparency through conversations with each other where people can raise their concerns in a coureageous and compassionate way so that issues can be worked on together. It sets a framework whereby individuals are empowered to decide how to best move the business forward without necessarily needing managerial approval. Leaders should act as role models here. If they don't have time to talk, if they follow prescriptive processes without taking a step back and looking at the bigger picture, that behavior will likely also cascade down to their managers and team members.

| Key Principles | Rationale for leaders |
|:------|:------|
| Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.<img width=900/>| Favor collective intelligence over silo comfort through constant collaboration. Simple communication can prevent small issues from becoming big issues. When developers liaise with the business, they open the door to deciding what work to take on rather than having work thrown over the wall to them.|
| The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.| Nurture cohesive partnerships by bringing together contrasting experiences and letting ideas flow. Opportunities can be uncovered even in 5-10 minute conversations. Note how you can use tools to still have effective remote face to face interactions.|
| Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.| This goes beyond mentoring. Trust that each individual will do their best, align your team to the greater goal and inspire them through purpose. View your team members as people, not resources, and create a culture that synergizes diversity of thought.|
| At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.| Advocate courage and respect to empower inspection and adaptation opportunities. Implement a sustainable work pace as well as feedback loops that allows your team to focus on and improve processes and behaviors that matter most.|

**Working software over comprehensive documentation** where 'software' can be substituted for customer solutions. Being relevant in your target market is single biggest measure of success and what you should value the most. Documentation should still happen in a manner that provides value to your team. The Agile practices tend to leverage documentation to ensure everyone is on the same page. One of Scrum's pillar is transparency, where the project goal and upcoming priorities must be available to all stakeholders at all times to enable close inspection and adaptation. Likewise, Kanban at its core visualizes how value flows through an organization's system or process to help identify improvement opportunities. Both practices centre their documentation around progress towards strategic goals rather than going overboard with tactical tracking of activity (such as the number of completed tasks per person/team/department).

| Key Principles | Rationale for leaders |
|:------|:------|
| Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.<img width=573/>| Establish customer centricity as your top priority and connect social impact with business impact as you deliver to market.|
| Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.| Streamline (documentation) practices in order to further work and conversations towards the desired goal. Operate in a way that things will change and don't over-document items that will change.|
| Working software is the primary measure of progress.| Prioritize functioning solutions that are either utilized or needed by the market. Being empirical (seeing your reality objectively) will help you enable competitive advantage.|
| Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.| Break down complex problems into smaller and more achievable yet effective objectives which can be rapidly provided to the market.|
| The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.| Let the team that is closest to the work self-manage. Avoid making all the decisions and refrain from dividing teams as the most impactful solution will be a product multiple thinkers, not one. Help promote good design by keeping things simple as an enhancer to agility.|

**Customer collaboration over contract negotiation** encourages open and honest lines of communication with your customer. Whether that customer is external or an internal stakeholder, the feedback should flow in terms of product usage and value. Agreement on time and budget is still of absolute importance. However, there should be room to act on market indicators. If the scope of requirements is changing, the business shouldn't by trapped by mandates or have no other choice but to renegotiate terms. Rather than signing off scoped plans and working harder to get things moving, organizations can use product owners to analyze what actions are most appropriate based on what is currently known from the market. Product Owners collaborate with both the customer and development team to quickly deliver on the slices most valuable to customers.

| Key Principles | Rationale for leaders |
|:------|:------|
| Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.<img width=80/>|Embrace adaptation as you serve your customers with a focus on their convenience.|
| Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.| Achieve a holistic outlook of complex problems and harness creative solutions through the personal impact of multiple perspectives.|
| Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.| Create a participative culture where individuals are self driven, remove bottlenecks and support each other to boost the team performance towards a common shared vision.|
| Working software is the primary measure of progress.| Ensure your measurement of success is right. Focus on outcomes rather than outputs or activities.|
| Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.  | Revolve everything you do around delighting your customers. Gather voice of customer and other customer centric product / service usage indicators to help you understand and finetune the value of your offerings.|

**Responding to change over following a plan** creates an environment in which focused creativity flourishes over status quo processes. Things should move quickly to improve. Customer solutions should be punctually redefined to respond to market trends. While we all make plans, the prime benefit of being able to pivot is that risk is reduced. As the transmission of new information flows through the business, it is important that projects have leeway to change course at the drop of a hat to deliver business value as fast as possible.

| Key Principles | Rationale for leaders |
|:------|:------|
| Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.| Encourage change, pivot to increase cycle times where possible and support creativity and innovation.|
| Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.| Solve customer pain-points quickly and incrementally before your competitors provide better choices.|
| Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.| Delivering often builds trust and ensures experiments and innovations are either quickly validated or discarded.|
| Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.| Changes come from demos and interactions and these short feedback loops can reduce risk as well as the impact of change.<img width=574/>|
