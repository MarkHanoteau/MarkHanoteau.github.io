As the Agile Manifesto celebrates its 20th anniversary this year, I thought it'd be fitting to follow up on my recent Scrum Product Owner certification the day of my birthday with my first true LinkedIn post to reflect on what Agile has meant for me and other leaders within my company, client ecosystem as well as many more businesses around the world.

Agile Transformation is nothing new. It is a long-running product of leaders striving to shape their businesses into a leaner, nimbler organization capable of fulfilling increasingly demanding customer needs and expectations whilst being cost effective. Amongst the myriad of choices to make - selecting the right technology stack fit for their organization being one of them - comes how to adopt Agile in a valuable manner. In their efforts to thouroughly understand the Agile principles, values, frameworks and methodologies and how appropriate each of these may be for the way they would like to their company to perform, leaders risk distracting themselves from fundamental soft skills that nurture operational success. 

Scrum shapes these soft skills into five values that a team's success depends on. I'll provide some high priority examples from professional environments that illustrates how respecting these values may prove instrumental in ensuring business agility. 

Courage: 

It is unfortunately more common that we'd like for teams to get lost into busy work; to confuse high volumes of tasks completed as high performance. Leaders have a duty to intervene in these instances, and to educate their teams on how important it is for them to bias their work towards output and outcome focused activities. It likely will take courage to break these habits - people don't like being told what they've been doing adds no value - and to do so leaders need to have a clear vision that they firmly believe in. As a Scrum Product Owner, I frequently refer to the Evidenced Based Management Guide to shape this vision and ensure my team's endeavors are strategic. It has been extremely helpful in identifying what we should focus on as a team, and what is not worth our time.

Commitment:

I see a lot of practices wrongly claim that they adhere to Scrum. One of the most common examples of this is teams skipping one of the formal Scrum meetings (Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective). Each of these events are designed to make the process and work transparent, which in turn enables inspection and identification of opportunities to improve and adapt in a timely and iterative manner. Should you fail to respect these events, you are not following Scrum as you are deviating from the Agile benefits the framework intends to implement. It is important for leaders to understand the Scrum Guide, and should they decide it is the ideal framework to adopt given their market pressures and scope of work, to commit to the Scrum rules. 

Focus: 

As part of their strategic planning, leaders may be tempted to overstretch and set challenges for their teams that unrealistically go beyond the team's current capabilities. When designing the roadmap towards strategic goals, it is important for leaders to focus on the present, and set intermediate objectives in incremental steps based on what is empirically known and achievable. This will build confidence and excitement within the team as they gradually complete the objectives and progress towards the strategic goal. 

Openness:



Respect.
