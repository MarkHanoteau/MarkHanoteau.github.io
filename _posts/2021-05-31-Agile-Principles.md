The Agile Manifesto values covered in [Part 1](https://markhanoteau.github.io/2021-05-30-Agile-Values/) are backed up by [12 Agile principles](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) that help instill agile thinking. The tables below break each value down by listing which principles I believe most underpin each value along with a review of how leaders may put these into practice to benefit their companies.

**Individuals and interactions over processes and tools** 

| Key Principles | Rationale for leaders |
|:------|:------|
| Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.<img width=900/>| Favor collective intelligence over silo comfort through constant collaboration. Simple communication can prevent small issues from becoming big issues. When developers liaise with the business, they open the door to deciding what work to take on rather than having work thrown over the wall to them.|
| The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.| Nurture cohesive partnerships by bringing together contrasting experiences and letting ideas flow. Opportunities can be uncovered even in 5-10 minute conversations. Note how you can use tools to still have effective remote face to face interactions.|
| Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.| This goes beyond mentoring. Trust that each individual will do their best, align your team to the greater goal and inspire them through purpose. View your team members as people, not resources, and create a culture that synergizes diversity of thought.|
| At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.| Advocate courage and respect to empower inspection and adaptation opportunities. Implement a sustainable work pace as well as feedback loops that allows your team to focus on and improve processes and behaviors that matter most.|  

**Working software over comprehensive documentation** 

| Key Principles | Rationale for leaders |
|:------|:------|
| Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.<img width=573/>| Establish customer centricity as your top priority and connect social impact with business impact as you deliver to market.|
| Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.| Streamline (documentation) practices in order to further work and conversations towards the desired goal. Operate in a way that things will change and don't over-document items that will change.|
| Working software is the primary measure of progress.| Prioritize functioning solutions that are either utilized or needed by the market. Being empirical (seeing your reality objectively) will help you enable competitive advantage.|
| Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.| Break down complex problems into smaller and more achievable yet effective objectives which can be rapidly provided to the market.|
| The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.| Let the team that is closest to the work self-manage. Avoid making all the decisions and refrain from dividing teams as the most impactful solution will be a product multiple thinkers, not one. Help promote good design by keeping things simple as an enhancer to agility.|

**Customer collaboration over contract negotiation** 

| Key Principles | Rationale for leaders |
|:------|:------|
| Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.<img width=80/>|Embrace adaptation as you serve your customers with a focus on their convenience.|
| Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.| Achieve a holistic outlook of complex problems and harness creative solutions through the personal impact of multiple perspectives.|
| Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.| Create a participative culture where individuals are self driven, remove bottlenecks and support each other to boost the team performance towards a common shared vision.|
| Working software is the primary measure of progress.| Ensure your measurement of success is right. Focus on outcomes rather than outputs or activities.|
| Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.  | Revolve everything you do around delighting your customers. Gather voice of customer and other customer centric product / service usage indicators to help you understand and finetune the value of your offerings.|

**Responding to change over following a plan** 

| Key Principles | Rationale for leaders |
|:------|:------|
| Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.| Encourage change, pivot to increase cycle times where possible and support creativity and innovation.|
| Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.| Solve customer pain-points quickly and incrementally before your competitors provide better choices.|
| Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.| Delivering often builds trust and ensures experiments and innovations are either quickly validated or discarded.|
| Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.| Changes come from demos and interactions and these short feedback loops can reduce risk as well as the impact of change.<img width=574/>|
