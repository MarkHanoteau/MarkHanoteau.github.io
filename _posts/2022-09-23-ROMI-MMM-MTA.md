Prompt me for an elevator pitch on Marketing and an osmosis of customer centric topics will most probably spring to my mind: 
* Know your customer
* Personalize with intelligence
* Engage across the customer journey
* Grow and deepen relationships

It sure feels gratifying to solve customer problems. What consumes more of my mental energy is achieving such outcomes in a way that also drives business value. Perhaps it's just me. However, many marketers - even those that pride themselves as great storytellers - notoriously struggle to transparently demonstrate the effectiveness of marketing on their business' financial outcomes. 

Marketing can use a combination of three approaches to continuously pivot and optimize towards these financial outcomes:

ROMI, MMM and MTA are three techniques that provide an integrated and business oriented view of marketing performance. They allow you to empirically set top down campaign budgets and give each investment the best chance of an incremental pay off for a business. This has become a critical skill for the modern marketer. Executives think of Marketing as a cost vs return tool first and foremost. Accountants definitely classify Marketing as an expense on income statements. How to best spend in support of the business' goals - how to clearly identify and report on revenue and profit opportunities - is an organizational language that top management understands. 

With Marketing being an investment, one of the single most important equations in marketing has to be the Return On Marketing Investment aka **ROMI.**

Let's break the ROMI equation down:

> ROMI = ( Incremental margin − Marketing investment ) / Marketing investment 

The concept of incremental margin is critical piece within our measurement. In a world where increases and revenues can be driven by several external factors beyond seasonality, you want to calculate returns that were directly influenced by Marketing. Let's spend a few seconds understanding incremental margins by considering this simplistic example: 

| Treatment group | Control group |
|:------|:------|
| Mailed Sample 500,000| Non Mailed Sample 25,000|
| 3000 responders| 36 organic sales|
| 0.60% Treated rate| 0.12% Control rate|  

> The incremental response is 2400 = (0.6% - 0.12%) * 500,000..

> .. and Marketing should take credit for 80% for the 3000 influenced responders (2400/3000)

ROMI allows you to compare efficiencies between different marketing investments. It guides you on marketing budget allocation to best maximise incremental margins - by seperating the effect of marketing on revenues that would have been organically achieved. 

ROMI-led companies use past performance results from time series techniques like marketing or media mix modelling - **MMM** - as part of their strategic planning. MMM compares market level incremental impact of online and offline marketing initiatives on revenues.  Marketers can use this to estimate the optimal marketing mix amongst campaign and channel alternatives and allocate budgets proportionally according to what is most likely to pay off. 

Once the MMM budgets are set, Multi-Touch Attribution - **MTA** - tracks audience level online performance in flight. It is a solution that determines the relative contribution of individual customer touchpoints towards a goal. MTA allows marketers to make smarter tactical optimization decisions in near real-time, such as which call to action to use or which keywords to bid on. 


Marketers’ need for an integrated view of their marketing performance is as critical as ever. While marketing mix modeling and multi-touch attribution have their distinct advantages, marketers can realize the highest returns when they are used in tandem. By bringing insights from both methods of analysis together, marketers can get the comprehensive view of performance they need to inform their next best action within and across channels.

For example, consider a brand that is running multiple campaigns across a number of online and offline channels. Using marketing mix modeling, the brand can analyze all the drivers of performance and determine how to best allocate its budget between channels on a quarterly or annual basis. Using multi-touch attribution, the brand can then drill down deeper and allocate channel budgets to the highest-performing publishers, placements, keywords, creatives, and other tactics while campaigns are still in flight. Armed with this strategic -and tactical-level insight, brands can make a broad array of decisions to maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of their entire marketing portfolios.

Most brands today rely on both online and offline channels to drives sales, revenue and other desired business outcomes. By leveraging a holistic measurement approach that reconciles data and insight from marketing mix modeling and multi-touch attribution, marketers can enjoy the truly comprehensive view they need to make the right decisions, at the right time, to optimize performance across every area of investment.


Collecting the right data, making sense of complex and varied data, adding to the data.
