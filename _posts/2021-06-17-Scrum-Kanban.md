Imagine an instance where it's taking you or your team longer than anticipated to finish work. A new request comes in. Given your current turnaround times, you might intuitively chose to get started on the new item as early as you can and give yourself a chance to complete it on time, even if it adds to your workload. 

If this resonates with your work habits, this post is for you. When you take on more work, you prolong the duration to finish your workload. This unravels into an unsustainable cycle as more work comes in. As your attention gets devoured by completing tasks, you lose focus of the bigger picture and miss opportunities to rectify the state of affairs. If the speed of delivery suffers, it also threatens work quality, revenues, team morale and ultimately, stakeholder credibility.

This [Busy Bee Paradox](https://hakanforss.wordpress.com/2014/11/18/the-busy-bee-paradox/) might be challenging to accept but it is supported by a theorem called [Little's Law](https://scrumorg-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/drupal/2018-05/Little%E2%80%99s%20Law%20for%20Professional%20Scrum%20with%20Kanban.pdf). [Little's Law](https://www.process.st/littles-law/) relates how long it takes to finish work to how much work you can complete, given your current work in progress.

The key implication of Little's Law is that you need to work on less items if you want to work faster. If it takes you too long to complete your scope of work, you should break it down into smaller, more manageable items and focus exclusively on these. In short, Little Law gives you all the justification you ever needed to refocus. If Leaders want to utilize their teams to their full potential and enable them to deliver higher quality work faster than ever before, they should implement a limit on the number of items that the team will work on at any given time, so that the team can focus on the current work in progress. 

Limiting Work in Progress allows you to finish your current work instead of starting new work. This is a key component of the Kanban method and is arguably its single most underappreciated quality. It puts people first and protects individuals from being overwhelmed with the chaos that comes with frantic work. It also benefits the company by giving team members time to cope with the complexity of their work, to improve processes and to collaborate and synergize with peers and partners. Finally, it implicitly ends any order-taker dynamic with stakeholders as having a workload limit helps you decide when to start new work. If you'd like more insight around the benefits of moving away from accepting and fastracking last minute requests, I highly recommend Daniel Vacanti's fascinating explanation of how [an expedite request sunk the Titanic](https://vimeo.com/239539858). 

For Kanban to be succesful, the flow of work doesn't just need to be limited but actively managed. I'll dedicate another post on how to optimize the flow of work but I'll conclude this one with a couple of teasers: 

* Once you have stabilised your workflow, Kanban takes you to another level with its probabilistic [forecasting techniques](https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/create-faster-and-more-accurate-forecasts-using-probabilities). On top of saving time estimating work, it will put you in the safest position you answer the eternal and inevitable stakeholder question of when you expect to finish the work, in a language that they understand (as opposed to story point estimations, for example). 
* Kanban can also combine [its great practices with those of Scrum](https://scrumorg-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/drupal/2021-01/01-2021%20Kanban%20Guide.pdf?nexus-file=https%3A%2F%2Fscrumorg-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fdrupal%2F2021-01%2F01-2021%2520Kanban%2520Guide.pdf) to turbo charge the pain free creation of valuable solutions for customers and enable businesses to succeed in modern complex business environments.
