Prompt me for an elevator pitch on Marketing and an osmosis of customer centric topics will most probably spring to my mind: 
* Know your customer
* Personalize with intelligence
* Engage across the customer journey
* Grow and deepen relationships

It sure feels gratifying to solve customer problems. What consumes more of my mental energy is achieving such outcomes in a way that also drives business value. Perhaps it's just me. However, many marketers - even those that pride themselves as great storytellers - notoriously struggle to transparently demonstrate the effectiveness of marketing on their business' financial outcomes. 

This article will help demystify the financial impact of Marketing. I will describe three ways to accurately measure past marketing performance, empirically decide how to set top down campaign budgets and how to ensure that each investment returns the likelier pay off for a business. This has become a critical skill for the modern marketer. Executives think of Marketing as a cost vs return tool first and foremost. Accountants definitely classify Marketing as an expense on income statements. How to best spend in support of the business' goals - how to clearly identify and report on revenue and profit opportunities - is an organizational language that top management understands. 

With Marketing being an investment, one of the single most important equations in marketing has to be the **Return On Marketing Investment** aka ROMI.

Let's break the ROMI equation down:

> ROMI = ( Incremental margin − Marketing investment ) / Marketing investment 

The incremental margin is of course a critical measurement as without it, we can't calculate returns. Consider this simplistic example: 

| Treatment group | Control group |
|:------|:------|
| Mailed Sample 500,000| Non Mailed Sample 25,000|
| 3000 responders| 36 organic sales|
| 0.60% Treated rate| 0.12% Control rate|  

> Then the incremental response is 2400 = (0.6% - 0.12%) * 500,000..

> .. and Marketing should take credit for 80% for the 3000 influenced responders (2400/3000)

ROMI allows you to compare efficiencies between different marketing investments. It guides you on marketing budget allocation to best maximise incremental margins - by seperating the effect of marketing on revenues that would have been organically achieved. 

ROMI-led companies use past performance results from time series techniques like marketing or media mix modelling - **MMM** - as part of their strategic planning. MMM compares high level incremental impact of online and offline marketing initiatives on revenues.  Marketers can use this to estimate the optimal marketing mix amongst campaign and channel alternatives and allocate budgets proportionally according to what is most likely to pay off. 

Once the MMM budgets are set, Multi-Touch Attribution - **MTA** - tracks granular dimensions of in flight online performance. It is a solution that determines the relative contribution of individual customer touchpoints towards a goal. MTA allows marketers to make smarter tactical optimization decisions in near real-time, such as which call to action to use or which keywords to bid on.


A fundamental problem in measuring advertising effectiveness is to quantify how revenue should be attributed to multiple touch-points along consumers' conversion
paths, which is the sequence, timing, and engagement in advertising channels along the purchase funnel.

By assembling information about user characteristics, media touch points, and sales/conversion data, marketers can understand which combination of channels,
audience targets, publishers, devices, creatives, search keywords, or other marketing considerations are performing most effectively against their Key Performance Indicator (KPI). Thus, they are widely regarded by practitioners as a proxy for optimizing campaign performance. Contrary to media mix modeling, it is a bottom-up measurement approach that requires individual-level data.

An individual's consumer's decision to purchase has four distinct drivers:
*Purchase propensity (predisposition to purchase)
*Traditional media
*Non marketing drivers (seasonality, discounts, economy)
*Digital media


**Optimize all marketing investments, holistically. Achieve Better Results by Combining Methods**

Unified analytics combines the functionality of a market level, top down model (MMM) and an audience-level, bottom up model. 

By combining both approaches, marketers can further corroborate which channels are contributing to the pre-defined KPIs while preventing misguided conclusions when gaps between these two methods arise. Blending the detailed view from MTA with the higher-level analysis provided by marketing mix modeling, companies gain more
accurate measurements. However, the different data sources and levels of data capture make the automated reconciliation of the two approaches difficult. 

Marketers’ need for an integrated view of their marketing performance is as critical as ever. While marketing mix modeling and multi-touch attribution have their distinct advantages, marketers can realize the highest returns when they are used in tandem. By bringing insights from both methods of analysis together, marketers can get the comprehensive view of performance they need to inform their next best action within and across channels.

For example, consider a brand that is running multiple campaigns across a number of online and offline channels. Using marketing mix modeling, the brand can analyze all the drivers of performance and determine how to best allocate its budget between channels on a quarterly or annual basis. Using multi-touch attribution, the brand can then drill down deeper and allocate channel budgets to the highest-performing publishers, placements, keywords, creatives, and other tactics while campaigns are still in flight. Armed with this strategic -and tactical-level insight, brands can make a broad array of decisions to maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of their entire marketing portfolios.

Most brands today rely on both online and offline channels to drives sales, revenue and other desired business outcomes. By leveraging a holistic measurement approach that reconciles data and insight from marketing mix modeling and multi-touch attribution, marketers can enjoy the truly comprehensive view they need to make the right decisions, at the right time, to optimize performance across every area of investment.



* Find ways to bring incremental revenues beyond seasonality and cannibalism. 
* Collecting the right data, making sense of complex and varied data, adding to the data. 

Increase efficiency: develop top down framework for customer engagment. 

"You have to spend money to make money" adage is never been truer than in Marketing. 

Effectiveness: how do we get more out of everything that we do in Marketing?
