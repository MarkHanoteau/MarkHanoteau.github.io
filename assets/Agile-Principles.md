Agile is not going to work if you don't follow the Agile values. 

People first mindset. Employees first, customers first.

Agile is a set of four values backed up by twelve principles that outline as its essence how we work, how we work together and what we decide to work on.

This is not just applicable to software. The language of the values and principles was crafted by individuals who came from the software industry back in 2001. Since then, many sectors have applies these principles from Human Resources, Marketing, Law, Accounting Data Science and Manufacturing. Feel free to remove the word software with 'achieving outcomes or delivering products or service' to take it away from the software environment to a situation that is more applicable to you. 

The world is unpredictable, can{t stick to a plan for something that is no longer of value. You need to be adaptable when things change. 

Agile is the way of thinking. It's an associated mindset of improving our ways of working that is critical in an ever changing world. 

What values and principles make the team really tick and be succesful?

We need to do some planning. 

How can we use these values and principles to improve?

being agile means that we can move quickly and break things. It means that we reduce risk to our businesses by being able to change course at the drop of a hat. It means that product development is ongoing and we’re continually improving and redefining what the product is. It means we’re delivering business value as fast as possible.

Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

Can you have 1-1 conversations with each other and raise your concerns in a courageous and compassionate way, come to some kind of agreement and be role models for your team on how to work through these issues together. Focus on what is more important to the company, be open and transparent with each other as you commit to the company goals. 

If you don't have time to talk, that behavior cascades down to your managers and their team members. 

If we take the first point, in my mind, that means that we should just talk to each other. It means that we shouldn’t have all the bureaucracy that comes with larger firms. We shouldn’t need to go to managers to get an approval to talk to another team. We should be able to just do it without anyone looking at you sideways. We shouldn’t rely on what’s written in JIRA when the guy who wrote the stuff in JIRA is sitting next to you.

Working software over comprehensive documentation
I know some people who love to document. They write comments in their code and the requirements lists are ten pages long. But requirements change. You don’t need to write that huge document or workflow diagram at the very start. What you thought or plan might not even be needed. That’s not to say you shouldn’t write anything — but the documentation you write should provide value to the team — something that’ll speed up development.

Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
I think again this comes down to talking with your customer rather than renegotiating terms when something in the scope changes. Your customer doesn’t necessarily have to be external. It could be your Product Owner or your stakeholders. You just need to be open and honest when communicating with them. Let them know when the scope changes or when you realise you don’t need that component you’ve been working on for a few weeks. People are understanding.

Responding to change over following a plan
We all make plans. Agile doesn’t necessarily just apply to IT. Let’s say you’re planning a wedding — the agile way. Let’s say you’ve got your wedding day. You’re planning to get married on a beach. It rains and the tide’s in. You can follow your plan — and get wet and see your set being washed away. Or-or you can respond to the change in weather and get married at your bach with the stormy beach as a scene behind your vows. It’s not what you expected — or what you originally wanted. But you got married. That’s the main thing. You don’t have to follow your original plan if things change.

> .. We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:  

> .. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools  
> .. Working software over comprehensive documentation  
> .. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation  
> .. Responding to change over following a plan  

> .. That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

Two sides of each value statements. The things on the left are valued over the things on the right. 

This is important, because we absolutely still want to do plenty of plannning and documenting our work or have processes. Responding to change, customer centricity, working software and individuals and interactions are just valued more. We don{t forget about the items on the right hand side. 

If you have other principles assigned to each value, you are most probably also right. 

Principles behind the Agile Manifesto


> .. We follow these principles:  
> .. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.  

> .. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.  

> .. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.  

> .. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.  

> .. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.  

> .. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.  

> .. Working software is the primary measure of progress.  

> .. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.  

> .. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.  

> .. Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.  

> .. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.  

> .. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.
