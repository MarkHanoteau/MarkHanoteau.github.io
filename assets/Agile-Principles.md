Agile is a mindset that puts people first. It unleashes your employees' potential in order to benefit your customers. This is unlikely to be done by squeezing more work out of your team members but instead by creating an environment of participative leadership that autonmously removes sources of waste, dysfunctions and impediments to business value. 

Paramount to achieving these outcomes is the endorsement of the four values and twelve principles captured in the Agile Manifesto. These propositions are not just applicable to sofware and hold true if you interchange the word software with whichever term (e.g. product, service) that is relevant within your sector. The essence of the Manifesto outlines how to improve our collaborative ways of working in an ever changing world.  
 
So how can you help your team really tick and be succesful? The Agile Manifesto states:

> .. We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:  

> .. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools  
> .. Working software over comprehensive documentation  
> .. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation  
> .. Responding to change over following a plan  

> .. That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

The last sentence is key: you should not overlook the right side of the statement. You'll still enable your work through proccesses and accelerate it using tools. You'll still need acute documentation. You absolutely still want to do plenty of plannning. Individuals and interactions, working software, customer centricity and responding to change are just valued more. 

**Individuals and interactions over processes and tools** looks to foster an environment of genuine commitment over compliance. It favors openness and transparency through conversations with each other where people can raise their concerns in a coureageous and compassionate way so that issues can be worked on together. It sets a framework whereby individuals are empowered to decide how to best move the business forward without necessarily needing managerial approval. Leaders should act as role models here. If they don't have time to talk, that behavior will likely also cascade down to their managers and team members.

**Working software over comprehensive documentation**
I know some people who love to document. They write comments in their code and the requirements lists are ten pages long. But requirements change. You don’t need to write that huge document or workflow diagram at the very start. What you thought or plan might not even be needed. That’s not to say you shouldn’t write anything — but the documentation you write should provide value to the team — something that’ll speed up development.

**Customer collaboration over contract negotiation**
I think again this comes down to talking with your customer rather than renegotiating terms when something in the scope changes. Your customer doesn’t necessarily have to be external. It could be your Product Owner or your stakeholders. You just need to be open and honest when communicating with them. Let them know when the scope changes or when you realise you don’t need that component you’ve been working on for a few weeks. People are understanding.

**Responding to change over following a plan.**
Whilst we all make plans, being agile means we are in an environment in which focused creativity flourishes and things can move quickly to improve or redefine customer solutions. The prime benefit is that risk is reduced as the transmission of new information flows quickly through the business, enabling it to change course at the drop of a hat to deliver business value as fast as possible.

The values are backed up by 12 principles. I have taken the liberty to break each value down and list which principles I believe most underpin each value. As you go through my tabs, you may find other principles that support specific values. Reach out to me if you do! I'd be interested to hear your thoughts.
