What is productive to know vs what is noise. 

Asking people to do things without context is a disaster for morale and outcomes. 

From a process perspective: clarity in terms of a value stream. Repeated activities over time. Knowing what that looks like means we know what the challenges are, we know what the bottlenecks are. We know where investing in flow and investing in quality - velocity will pay off. We're not trying to automate everything. 

We are able to target our efforts at what's going to make the biggest difference. That has really profound effects on people because we see more progress that way, we see this cause and effect, we see tighter feedback loops where we are working on things that make a difference. 

Upstream, downstream clarity of relationships. 

In a value stream there are people who are affecting my work and people who are affected by my work. Seeing the value stream and my relationship to it adds this clarity of team inclusion and empathy for everyoone has to deal with what comes from upstream. Value stream mapping is a great way to step away from the day to day tasks and think about how to best invest time - enegery - resources into improvement without making a guess.
