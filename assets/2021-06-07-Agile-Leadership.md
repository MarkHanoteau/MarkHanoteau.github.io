Turn self-managing teams to your advantage by enabling people to do their best.

Are you happy with the extent your team depends on you to move things forward? 

How do your team members feel about being (un)empowered to make decisions? 

Let's explore the invirgorating benefit of implementing a framework where each individual has controlled room to make decisions on their own and learn from their experiences as they go. To get the best out of your business, you need to get the best out of your people. An obvious way to accomplish this rationale is by unleashing the thinking potential of your employees. The advantage here is that these individuals are more likely to be engaged on their own ideas rather than anything imposed on them, often leading them to go beyond the call of duty. In addition, this allows you to spend most of your time delineating strategy rather than helping your team with tactical matters, ensuring your team has a real sense of purpose on top of their autonomy. Autonomy comes with a catch: it needs to be balanced with accountability. Whilst it makes sense for those closest to the work to make most of the decisions, there is also no excuse for them to not make their progress transparent. 

Agile leadership burgeons this perspective. In turn, it depends on people-first leadership for its survival. It calls this approach servant leadership, a style being practiced in some of the top-ranking companies [due to its success](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/107179190200900205). 

As I prepared for the Professional Agile Leadership certification, I came across this [blog](https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/business-agility) which helps explain how servant leadership fits into organizational structures.

How do you scale leadership without adding boxes on the org chart?

I work with many people who find these ideas compelling but challenging to implement for two main reasons.

First, there’s plain old change resistance. Managers got where they are by managing a certain way. It’s what they know and what their organizations reward, while servant leadership (though already a 40+ year-old concept) seems like an unproven gamble with a weird name. Many managers remain accountable for results, so they’re afraid to relinquish control. Others (and I see this often) don’t truly trust their teams enough.

And second, 99.99% of organizations will never be anywhere near flat, and small teams can only know and do so much within the bigger context.

While organizations have indeed been allowing teams greater control of their work, many have landed on unhealthy and ineffectual leadership patterns. Do you see any of the following in your team or organization?
Team-level leaders, such as Scrum Masters, act more like servants than leaders. Or, they lead in a bubble, while the more-powerful organization around them does not employ Agile leadership.
Managers allow folks to choose their tasks from a sprint backlog, but don’t empower them further.
Senior managers allow teams to use Agile practices, while saying, “I don’t care how you execute as long as you deliver on the plan.”
Avoid or overcome these patterns by adopting a richer view of Agile leadership. Consider these additional Agile beliefs:
People won’t bring their best selves to work if they don’t feel safe to do so.
Teams should have autonomy — with direction.
Self-direction does not imply smooth flow.
A team may not evolve to greatness without help.
Over-optimizing for a team can sub-optimize for the organization.
Put another way: don’t just think about a group of individuals performing work. Think of leadership as enabling an entire complex human system inside a bigger complex context.

This expanded perspective will help you rethink roles and the needs fulfilled by leadership. It reframes team-level leadership as enabling real teamwork, among willing participants, connected to the larger dynamic and purpose. It focuses mid-level and senior leaders on enabling larger groups’ culture and systems. These leaders are definitely not servants, but leaders who focus on others before themselves and serve the greater whole.
