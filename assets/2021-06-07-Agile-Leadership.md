How do you scale leadership without adding boxes on the org chart?

Teams and organizations depend on people-first leadership for real Agility. Reflect for a moment: How would you characterize the approach to leadership in your organization?

Over the years, a certain model of Agile leadership has evolved. It is based on the servant leadership approach, which realizes that it’s complex human beings (not controllable “resources”) who produce business results.

Several beliefs lie at the heart of servant leadership:
People’s engagement is voluntary, and they need some autonomy.
People need purpose, which should be meaningful to them.
People take better action on ideas of their own.
Those closest to the work should make most of the decisions.
When leaders create environments and systems that respect these beliefs, people can do their best work in service of the organization. This thinking is meant to be pragmatic, not touchy-feely.

I work with many people who find these ideas compelling but challenging to implement for two main reasons.

First, there’s plain old change resistance. Managers got where they are by managing a certain way. It’s what they know and what their organizations reward, while servant leadership (though already a 40+ year-old concept) seems like an unproven gamble with a weird name. Many managers remain accountable for results, so they’re afraid to relinquish control. Others (and I see this often) don’t truly trust their teams enough.

And second, 99.99% of organizations will never be anywhere near flat, and small teams can only know and do so much within the bigger context.

While organizations have indeed been allowing teams greater control of their work, many have landed on unhealthy and ineffectual leadership patterns. Do you see any of the following in your team or organization?
Team-level leaders, such as Scrum Masters, act more like servants than leaders. Or, they lead in a bubble, while the more-powerful organization around them does not employ Agile leadership.
Managers allow folks to choose their tasks from a sprint backlog, but don’t empower them further.
Senior managers allow teams to use Agile practices, while saying, “I don’t care how you execute as long as you deliver on the plan.”
Avoid or overcome these patterns by adopting a richer view of Agile leadership. Consider these additional Agile beliefs:
People won’t bring their best selves to work if they don’t feel safe to do so.
Teams should have autonomy — with direction.
Self-direction does not imply smooth flow.
A team may not evolve to greatness without help.
Over-optimizing for a team can sub-optimize for the organization.
Put another way: don’t just think about a group of individuals performing work. Think of leadership as enabling an entire complex human system inside a bigger complex context.

This expanded perspective will help you rethink roles and the needs fulfilled by leadership. It reframes team-level leadership as enabling real teamwork, among willing participants, connected to the larger dynamic and purpose. It focuses mid-level and senior leaders on enabling larger groups’ culture and systems. These leaders are definitely not servants, but leaders who focus on others before themselves and serve the greater whole.
