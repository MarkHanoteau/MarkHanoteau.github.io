The Busy Bee Paradox by Håkan Forss

Stop fully utilizing your teams. Busy work is the highest obstacle to value in knowledge - complex work. 

Stop being an order taker!

Overwhelmed with work?

[b]Overworked[/b]

How do you typically react when it's taking you longer than originally anticipated to finish work? Do you start new items on top of your current workload to ensure that those items are not impacted and finish on time? 

How does your manager respond when your team is requested to work on multiple priorities at once? 

As you think about these situations, let's come to terms with the fact that the more items you work on at any given time, the longer it will take you to finish these items.

The workaround here is unfortunately not multitasking, where you're essentially putting an item an item of work aside to work on something else, only to come back to the first item later on. 

focus and clarity are luxuries. Waste comes in many forms, including:

Context switching
Excess meetings
Communication breakdowns
Rework
Duplicate effort
Handoff delays
Missed deadlines

As more work comes in, this can quickly unravel into a vicious and unsustainable cycle. 

This might feel counterproductive. People can be forgiven for thinking that if they had a busy day, they had a productive day at work. 

In my experience, this does not work with Knowledge Work. 

Leaders do tend to focus on resource efficiency / utilisation.

Without limiting WIP, it’s incredibly difficult to identify wasteful and inefficient processes.
The impact on our system can be disastrous, in terms of speed of delivery, work quality, cost, and morale.

[b]Mathematical Proof[/b]

Average Cycle Time = Average Work In Progress / Average Throughput

The key implication of Little's Law is that you need to work on less items if you want to work faster. If it takes you too long to complete your scope of work, you should break it down into smaller, more manageable items and focus exclusively on these. In short, Little Law gives you all the justification you ever needed to refocus. 

Little’s Law establishes that there is a relation between how much work is in process (WIP), the time it takes to complete the work (Lead Time) and the amount of work you can deliver (Throughput).

Average Throughput = (Average WIP / Average Lead Time)

[b]Limit WIP[/b]

If Leaders want to utilize their teams to their full potential and enable them to deliver higher quality work faster than ever before, they should implement a limit on the number of items that the team will work on at any given time, so that the team can focus on the current work in progress. Finishing WIP instead of starting new work is a key component of the Kanban method.

WIP has one major implicit consequence: it empowers you to say no to work, and pull work. It certainly moves away from the often frantic and almost always unproductive chaos that ensues when accepting and fastracking any last minute requests - if you'd like more insight around this, I highly recommend Daniel Vacanti's explanation of how [an expedite request sunk the Titanic](https://vimeo.com/239539858). 

More time to focus on the work at hands opens up opportunities to collaborate and synergize with peers or partners. You’ll regain the luxuries of focus, creativity, and clarity, which will allow you to engage with your work in a more fulfilling way.

Have time to absorb the variability of work
Start truly collaborating
Improve their work and their processes, and
Remove the sources of delay & waste.
Completing work starts becoming more predictable, trust in the process increases, people have more opportunities to self-organise and so on.

Balancing WIP generates the conditions to improve Flow Efficiency. It also enables virtuous feedback loops that lead to successful, healthier businesses.

[b]Manage workflow[/b]

This means 

Not just a Kanban board although you can certainly start with your board and evolve steadily from there - just make sure your board has at least one 'active' state (doing, in progress, etc.) .

[b]Scrum with Kanban[/b]

In order to succeed in modern, complex business environments, we must create valuable solutions for our customers. The way that solution comes to life should be as pain free as possible (flow management). Scrum turbo charged by Kanban. Combining the best practices of Kanban with the best practices of Scrum.

For Kanban to be succesful, the flow of work doesn't just need to be optimized but actively managed. New post on how WIP can not just be limited but also optimized. The icing on the cake is that once you have stabilised your workflow, Kanban takes you to another level with its probabilistic [forecasting techniques](https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/create-faster-and-more-accurate-forecasts-using-probabilities), such as Monte Carlo, that on top of saving time estimating work, best help you answer the eternal and inevitable stakeholder question of when you expect to complete the work in the safest-most accurate way possible?  Steers away from the awful habit of story points.

No people values but puts people first by its very essence. Improve collaboratively. 

But, why exactly should you provide Kanban training for your Scrum Team?

The Flow of Empiricism
The key element of Kanban is the flow or the concept of flow as such. The flow in Kanban is basically the movement of value that is present in the entire lifecycle of product development. Kanban, therefore, focuses on optimizing this flow by improving both efficiency and effectiveness of a process, thus ultimately making it more predictable. 

When placed in the context of Scrum, optimizing the flow would require defining what the flow is, in the first place. The Scrum framework is based on empiricism, which defines the frequency of transparency, adaptation and inspection cycle. 

Simply put, you can describe it as a cycle time during the feedback loop. So, when practices native to Kanban are implemented in the Scrum framework, they can grant a certain focus on improving the flow during the feedback loop, thus optimizing the frequency for transparency, adaptation and inspection of both the product being developed and the development process.
