The Busy Bee Paradox by Håkan Forss

Stop fully utilizing your teams. Busy work is the highest obstacle to value in knowledge - complex work. 

The order taker fallacy. 

Overwhelmed with work?

[b]Overworked[/b]

Imagine an instance where it's taking you or your team longer than anticipated to finish work. A new request comes in. The intuitive choice to make, given your current turnaround times, might be to get started on the new item as early as you can and give yourself a chance to complete it on time, even if it adds to your workload. If this resonates with your work habits, this article is for you. 

The good news is that your response will most likely gain stakeholder support - at least in the short-term. The bad news is that as you take on more work, you prolong the duration to finish your workload. This unravels into an unsustainable cycle as more work comes in. As your attention gets devoured by completing tasks, you lose focus of the bigger picture and miss opportunities to rectify the state of affairs. If the speed of delivery suffers, it also threatens work quality, revenues, team morale and ultimately, stakeholder credibility.

This adverse association is supported by a theorem called [Little's Law](https://scrumorg-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/drupal/2018-05/Little%E2%80%99s%20Law%20for%20Professional%20Scrum%20with%20Kanban.pdf). Little's Law relates how long it takes to finish work to how much work you can complete, given your current work in progress. The key implication of Little's Law is that you need to work on less items if you want to work faster. If it takes you too long to complete your scope of work, you should break it down into smaller, more manageable items and focus exclusively on these. In short, Little Law gives you all the justification you ever needed to refocus. If Leaders want to utilize their teams to their full potential and enable them to deliver higher quality work faster than ever before, they should implement a limit on the number of items that the team will work on at any given time, so that the team can focus on the current work in progress. 

Limiting Work in Progress enables you to finish your current work instead of starting new work. This is a key component of the Kanban method and is arguably its single most underappreciated quality. It puts people first and protects individuals from being overwhelmed with work. This in turn benefits the company as it gives team members time to cope with the complexity of their work, to improve processes and to collaborate and synergize with peers and partners. It also opens up one major implicit consequence: it empowers you to decide when to start new work and moves teams away from the often frantic and almost always unproductive chaos that ensues when accepting and fastracking any last minute requests - if you'd like more insight around this, I highly recommend Daniel Vacanti's fascinating explanation of how [an expedite request sunk the Titanic](https://vimeo.com/239539858). 

For Kanban to be succesful, the flow of work doesn't just need to be limited but actively managed. I'll dedicate another post on how to optimize the flow of work but as a teaser, once you have stabilised your workflow, Kanban takes you to another level with its probabilistic [forecasting techniques](https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/create-faster-and-more-accurate-forecasts-using-probabilities). On top of saving time estimating work, it will put you in the safest position you answer the eternal and inevitable stakeholder question of when you expect to finish the work, in a language that they understand (as opposed to story point estimations). 

In order to succeed in modern, complex business environments, we must create valuable solutions for our customers. The way that solution comes to life should be as pain free as possible (flow management). Scrum turbo charged by Kanban. Combining the best practices of Kanban with the best practices of Scrum.

The Flow of Empiricism
The key element of Kanban is the flow or the concept of flow as such. The flow in Kanban is basically the movement of value that is present in the entire lifecycle of product development. Kanban, therefore, focuses on optimizing this flow by improving both efficiency and effectiveness of a process, thus ultimately making it more predictable. 

When placed in the context of Scrum, optimizing the flow would require defining what the flow is, in the first place. The Scrum framework is based on empiricism, which defines the frequency of transparency, adaptation and inspection cycle. 

Simply put, you can describe it as a cycle time during the feedback loop. So, when practices native to Kanban are implemented in the Scrum framework, they can grant a certain focus on improving the flow during the feedback loop, thus optimizing the frequency for transparency, adaptation and inspection of both the product being developed and the development process.

This might feel counterproductive. People can be forgiven for thinking that if they had a busy day, they had a productive day at work. 

In my experience, this does not work with Knowledge Work. 

Leaders do tend to focus on resource efficiency / utilisation.

Without limiting WIP, it’s incredibly difficult to identify wasteful and inefficient processes.
