Limiting WIP: 

WIP limits unlock the full potential of Kanban, enabling teams to deliver higher quality work faster than ever before, in a healthier, more sustainable environment.

Stop starting, start finishing
One of the biggest culprits of lengthening cycle times is multi-tasking. Well, we think we’re multitasking but what we’re actually doing is something called task switching — putting one thing aside to work on another and then coming back to the first thing later.

Implementing a limit to the number of things you will work on at a time can help individuals, teams, or even organizations focus on fewer items at a time, allowing them to deliver the items faster and, usually, with better quality. This limit is called a work-in-progress limit, or WIP limit, and is a key component of a Kanban system.

WIP has one major implicit consequence: it empowers you to say no to work, and pull work. 

Scrum turbo charged by Kanban.

Not just a Kanban board although you can certainly start with your board and evolve steadily from there - just make sure your board has at least one 'active' state (doing, in progress, etc.) .

New post on how WIP can not just be limited but also optimized. The icing on the cake is that once you have stabilised your workflow, Kanban takes you to another level with its probabilistic [forecasting techniques](https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/create-faster-and-more-accurate-forecasts-using-probabilities), such as Monte Carlo, that on top of saving time estimating work, best help you answer the eternal and inevitable stakeholder question of when you expect to complete the work in the safest-most accurate way possible?  Steers away from the awful habit of story points.

No people values but puts people first by its very essence.

But, why exactly should you provide Kanban training for your Scrum Team?

The Flow of Empiricism
The key element of Kanban is the flow or the concept of flow as such. The flow in Kanban is basically the movement of value that is present in the entire lifecycle of product development. Kanban, therefore, focuses on optimizing this flow by improving both efficiency and effectiveness of a process, thus ultimately making it more predictable. 

When placed in the context of Scrum, optimizing the flow would require defining what the flow is, in the first place. The Scrum framework is based on empiricism, which defines the frequency of transparency, adaptation and inspection cycle. 

Simply put, you can describe it as a cycle time during the feedback loop. So, when practices native to Kanban are implemented in the Scrum framework, they can grant a certain focus on improving the flow during the feedback loop, thus optimizing the frequency for transparency, adaptation and inspection of both the product being developed and the development process.
