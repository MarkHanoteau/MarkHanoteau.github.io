Scrum works not because it has three roles, five events, and three artifacts but because it adheres to the underlying Agile principles of iterative, value-based incremental delivery by frequently gathering customer feedback and embracing change. 

The point of Scrum isn't to do Scrum... it's to align the team and the organisation so that everyone is working towards a common goal.

Every day the team are focussed on taking the next step towards achieving the Sprint Goal.

Every Sprint Goal is a distinct step towards the Product Goal.

And the current Product Goal is intended to be a concrete milestone towards the Product Owner's vision for the product.

Imagine... your team understanding their purpose and working together as a single unit towards a clearly defined, valuable and achievable goal. Every day. Even when there are bumps in the road.

That's Scrum. Not all the dogma.
