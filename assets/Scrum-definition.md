What is Scrum about anyway?

Learn about Scrum and its benefits. This article allows you to chose whether to be exposed to jargon.. or not!

This post will be divided into 3 sequences. The first passage will focus on the value of scrum without using any of the terminology. The second adds the framework guidlines to allow for a fundamental understanding of Scrum. The final paragraph sprints through my recommendation on how to assimilate Scrum concepts in the most intuitive and enjoyable manner. 

**Understanding Scrum - Step 1: Focus on Value.**

(Allow yourself not to think about Scrum for the length of the paragraph. Move away from its rules, roles, meetings and commitments. Think differently. Instead, focus on the value it generates.) 

Imagine being fully accountable for your and your team's work.
Imagine everyone collaborating as a cohesive unit towards a common and valuable business outcome.
Imagine having this shared goal broken down into an intermediate objective which is within your realistic capabilities to accomplish in a short duration.
Imagine being confident that the output of your current work is the most valuable milestone you can produce within your scope of work. Imagine the feeling of each milestone being a step closer towards achieving your business outcome.
Imagine feeling empowered by guidance and validation from peers, customers and stakeholders as you progress through your work. 
Imagine being able to pivot your work and respond to this feedback in iterative and innovative measures, mitigating risk along the way. 

This is the essence of Scrum.

**Understanding Scrum - Step 2: Now letÂ´s add Scrum concepts.**

Allow yourself not to think about Scrum for the length of the paragraph. Move away from its rules, roles, meetings and commitments. Think differently. Instead, focus on the value it generates.

Bottom up thinking?

Now that you know the value, here's a snapshot of how scrum is applied:

For those who are super interested in knowing more: Valentin Despa

Scrum works not because it has three roles, five events, and three artifacts but because it adheres to the underlying Agile principles of iterative, value-based incremental delivery by frequently gathering customer feedback and embracing change. 

The point of Scrum isn't to do Scrum... it's to align the team and the organisation so that everyone is working towards a common goal.

Every day the team are focussed on taking the next step towards achieving the Sprint Goal.

Every Sprint Goal is a distinct step towards the Product Goal.

And the current Product Goal is intended to be a concrete milestone towards the Product Owner's vision for the product.

Imagine... your team understanding their purpose and working together as a single unit towards a clearly defined, valuable and achievable goal. Every day. Even when there are bumps in the road.

That's Scrum. Not all the dogma.
