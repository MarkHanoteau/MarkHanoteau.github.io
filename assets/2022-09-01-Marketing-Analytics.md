Marketing's  biggest C-suite communication challenge is to accurately prove how effective marketing strategies are on financial outcomes. This struggle ranges from fact-based past performance assessments just as much as empirically deciding whether to decrease or increase Marketing Budgets, or even, at a more tactical level, which future marketing investments will return the greater pay off.

Beyond cost control and profitability decision making, adopting a financial measure like 'Return On Marketing Investment' (ROMI) outlook sharpens the focus on business goals. By comparing the returns and costs of marketing, ROMI encourages transparency and builds trust as financial impact is a language that top management understands and evaluates against. ROMI helps compare marketing decisions by revealing the ones with the higher efficiency.

The ROMI can help in answering many marketing questions. For example:
1) How much return do we get from spending X amount on marketing?
2) How should we allocate our marketing budget to maximise our sales?

ROMI = Incremental margin − Marketing investment / Marketing investment 

**give WF example**

The measure enables the comparison of efficiencies between different marketing investments. It is typically calculated by doing a baseline-lift valuation on short-term sales, where the effect of a marketing effort on sales is separated from the level of sales that would have been reached without the marketing effort. 

Randomised experiments have also been applied successfully to
measure marketing effectiveness, and their cost has been brought down
by the Internet and digital measurement infrastructures 

**Plan Strategically with Marketing Mix Modeling**


ROMI-managed companies extensively use econometric or marketing mix models to aid the marketing mix decision-making process. The models help optimize ROMI beyond improving the measurement of returns; they allow marketing analysts to virtually estimate potential outcomes across a variety of circumstances performing “what-if scenarios” and to evaluate more quickly and efficiently a wide range of alternative options. MMM adds a critically important capability to ROMI management when building on a foundation of definitions and metrics developed through cross-functional teamwork.

The most commonly studied and applied ROMI method is marketing mix modelling (MMM) or when media is involved, 
media mix modelling, where historical data is used to represent sales as a function of advertising and marketing variables,
such as media spend, number of views and product price, and control
variables, such as weather, seasonality, and market competition. This can be used to adjust
marketing budgets. A lack of granular data, however, commonly limits the scope of MMM just
to studying the marketing effectiveness on a national level rather than,
for example, regionally or by product category. This limitation reduces
opportunities in detailed decision making and budgeting. MMM also
suffers from various downsides, such as lack of data, untested assumptions of market behaviour and various biases. 

MMM often suffers from various downsides, such as lack of data, deficient model forms and biases. Improving modelling granularity would enable marketers to analyse performance on lower levels and broaden their discussion on improvements. 

Marketing mix modeling is a top down modelling solution that measures the high-level impact of a range of marketing efforts on sales, will help guide budget allocation by showing how channel (incremental) performance compares, to get the optimal marketing mix. 
It models sales over time across digital and offline channels, as a function of advertising sales, other marketing variables and even control variables like weather, economic conditions, seasonality and competition.

Because of the impracticality of the conventional methods for studying
causality, companies often resort to using more straightforward marketing
mix modelling (MMM), aka media mix modelling, techniques. MMM attempts to model the demand response by fitting a model, typically an OLS
regression with various drivers and control factors, in historical data (Chan
and Perry, 2017). The results commonly include ROAS estimates for advertising channels and a break-down of the effect of different drivers. The
technique is cheap, fast and straightforward to apply as it typically involves
no experimentation. Yet, the validity of the results is often questionable.
The models are often based on inaccurate or unverified assumptions about
the nature of marketing environment and are
merely capable of producing correlational, not causal results.

Data used to fit marketing mix models are typically historical weekly or monthly aggregated national
data, although geo-level data can be used. The data includes:
 response data, typically sales but can be other KPI
 media metrics by channel, such as impressions, clicks, GRPs, with the cost being the most
commonly used
 marketing metrics such as price, promotion, product distribution
 control factors such as seasonality, weather or competition.

MMM typically uses four types of
data to fit their models:
• response data, which are typically volume or sales data,
• media metrics, which are commonly media spending data but sometimes other KPIs such as impressions and clicks,
• marketing metrics such as price, promotions, product distribution,
and
• control factors such as seasonality, weather and market competition.

The response data needs to be at the same level of granularity as the ads spend data. 


For example, companies often omit competitor data, such as marketing efforts
and prices, or ad exposure data, especially for offline media, because of
the difficulty of collecting reliable data. The omission can, in turn, lead to
inaccuracies in modelling. Overall, the lack of (reliable) data is one of the
main limitations of MMM.


Past performance may not be the best indicator for future performance.
Conventional MMM only provides an estimate of the past performance but does not specifically attempt to estimate what the performance will be in the future. Customer behaviour and market
conditions may change in the future and affect marketing performance and S-curves. Thus, the results from MMM should be used
with caution when making decisions.

Marketers have used MMM to move beyond cost management to optimize their mix and manage their top-line opportunities. MMMs allow marketers to estimate potential outcomes across a variety of circumstances—able to evaluate alternative hypotheses and select those most likely to payoff and to test them more rigorously because they do not have to test a thousand options. MMM tools can be productive as a means by which users enrich their judgmental processes by adding to their learning.

MMM is often criticized for its “rear-view mirror” or after the fact perspective of marketing mix impact. However, new simulation models can provide scenarios for managers to assess future potential results. 


**Optimize Tactically with Multi-Touch Attribution**
multitouch attribution (MTA) is a solution that suggest ways to optimize their marketing performance. 

Multi-touch attribution, on the other hand, offers tactical insights for short-term optimization. It focuses on addressable channels and leverages granular, user-level data to analyze performance in near real time. It does this by calculating and assigning fractional KPI credit to the marketing touchpoints and dimensions (publisher, placement, creative, offer, etc.) along the consumer journey that influenced a sales or other desired outcome. Marketers can use this insight to make smarter tactical decisions, such as which call to action to use or which keywords to bid on.

Attribution is the process of determining the relative contribution of individual campaign impressions
towards a goal for the purpose of performance measurement and optimization. The dominant
attribution methodology is last-touch, which assigns credit to only the last ad that a consumer
interacted with, before taking the desired action of the campaign. However, the last-touch model is
flawed because individuals are usually exposed to multiple advertising channels before making any 
purchasing decision. Therefore, a fundamental problem in measuring advertising effectiveness is to
quantify how revenue should be attributed to multiple touch-points along consumers' conversion
paths, which is the sequence, timing, and engagement in advertising channels along the purchase
funnel.
MTA is a solution for this measurement challenge since it assigns credit to multiple touch points
along the path to conversion. By assembling information about user characteristics, media touch
points, and sales/conversion data, marketers can understand which combination of channels,
audience targets, publishers, devices, creatives, search keywords, or other marketing considerations
are performing most effectively against their Key Performance Indicator (KPI). Thus, they are widely
regarded by practitioners as a proxy for optimizing campaign performance. Contrary to media mix modeling, it is a bottom-up measurement approach that
requires individual-level data.

**Achieve Better Results by Combining Methods**

By combining both approaches, marketers can further corroborate which channels are contributing
to the pre-defined KPIs while preventing misguided conclusions when gaps between these two
methods arise. For instance, a marketer may use MTA to determine the relative contributions of
display and paid search tactics to online revenue. Meanwhile, they may also use marketing mix
modeling to estimate the impact of those same tactics on offline sales. Blending the detailed view
from MTA with the higher-level analysis provided by marketing mix modeling, companies gain more
accurate measurements. However, the different data sources and levels of data capture make the
automated reconciliation of the two approaches difficult. 

Marketers’ need for an integrated view of their marketing performance is as critical as ever. While marketing mix modeling and multi-touch attribution have their distinct advantages, marketers can realize the highest returns when they are used in tandem. By bringing insights from both methods of analysis together, marketers can get the comprehensive view of performance they need to inform their next best action within and across channels.

For example, consider a brand that is running multiple campaigns across a number of online and offline channels. Using marketing mix modeling, the brand can analyze all the drivers of performance and determine how to best allocate its budget between channels on a quarterly or annual basis. Using multi-touch attribution, the brand can then drill down deeper and allocate channel budgets to the highest-performing publishers, placements, keywords, creatives, and other tactics while campaigns are still in flight. Armed with this strategic -and tactical-level insight, brands can make a broad array of decisions to maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of their entire marketing portfolios.

Most brands today rely on both online and offline channels to drives sales, revenue and other desired business outcomes. By leveraging a holistic measurement approach that reconciles data and insight from marketing mix modeling and multi-touch attribution, marketers can enjoy the truly comprehensive view they need to make the right decisions, at the right time, to optimize performance across every area of investment.
















To aid in evaluating new products, they have begun Monte Carlo simulations integrating the degrees of uncertainty and drivers of a project. The simulations enable the marketing team to assess the range of potential outcomes and to apply market models and to assess discounted cash flow. The analysis allows the understanding of likely outcomes to gain a degree of confidence of the amount of risk. Their risk-adjustment net-present-value model adjusts the hurdle rate over the life of the project to more accurately reflect the degree of risk that the organization is taking.“What-if” simulations permit marketing analysts to evaluate their databases and models, as well as testing out alter-native marketing options. Also, “What-if” or “Due-to” analyses can turn a postmortem on a disappointing promotion into a springboard to new, more effective programs for the future.
