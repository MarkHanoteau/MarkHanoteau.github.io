Increasingly, boards and CEOs are demanding hard empirical evidence that proposed marketing expenditures will yield greater profitability.

By focusing on ROMI, managers can not only empirically measure the marketing effectiveness of their assets, but can also compare the pay-offs from competing alternatives and make more informed decisions. 

Why does Marketing struggle so much to demonstrate it's financial returns / impact on financial outcomes?

Measuring the impact of marketing is essential for improving its performance and
justifying marketing decisions to top management. However, marketers often struggle
with it. 

To optimise marketing spending and to promote the accountability of
marketing, Stewart (2009) suggests developing industry-wide standardised measures for the short-term and long-term effects. The real options,
however, remain specific to each company and thus are not standardisable
as measures. The measures used for quantifying the short- and long-term
effects should be financial. According to Stewart (2009), this is important because it is the language that top management understands and
by which their performance is evaluated. Financial measures also enable
comparison and benchmarking between different actions. Without such
measures, making both strategic and tactical decisions becomes harder
and less fact-based. 

For example, it would be hard to decide whether to
decrease or increase the marketing budget without knowing whether the
decision would increase or decrease profits. Similarly, it would be challenging to decide on the allocation of the advertising budget between different
media if their effectiveness at different levels of spending is unknown. It
would also be tricky to select the optimal items and their discount rates for
promotion without an estimate of the incremental sales. Overall, financial
measures support decision making on both the strategic and the tactical
level.

To gain back their trust and influence, marketing departments need
to start measuring the impact of marketing – as is done with any other

Introduction
investment. 

From this marketing process, it is possible to identify different types
of returns. Stewart (2009) suggests that marketing has three types of
returns: short-term (incremental) effects, long-term (persistent) effects
and real options (see Figure 2.2)



One of the most commonly applied financial measures is the
return on marketing investment (ROMI) that combines both the returns
and costs of marketing into the equation

ROMI =
Incremental margin − Marketing investment / 
Marketing investment 

(According to Stewart (2009), marketing can be identified to
have three types of impacts: short-term (incremental) returns, e.g. sales,
long-term (persistent) effects, e.g. customer attitudes, and real options,
e.g. a higher price point enabled by a valued brand. )

 The measure enables the comparison
of efficiencies between different marketing investments. It is typically
calculated by doing a baseline-lift valuation on short-term sales, where
the effect of a marketing effort on sales is separated from the level of sales
that would have been reached without the marketing effort. Marketers
can adapt the measure to analyse different investments, for example, to
measure return on advertising spending (ROAS). The measure is criticised
by some researchers (e.g. Ambler and Roberts (2005); Rust et al. (2004))
for often only including short-term effects and disregarding any long-term
effects. Thus, other measures may be needed to support it.
Despite the short-termism of ROMI, researchers and companies have
done a considerable amount of research on the topic. The most commonly
studied and applied method is marketing mix modelling (MMM), aka
media mix modelling, where a regression model is fitted to historical data
to represent sales as a function of advertising and marketing variables,
such as media spend, number of views and product price, and control
variables, such as weather, seasonality, and market competition. The
outputs are typically ROAS figures for media, which can be used to adjust
marketing budgets. The method is popular as it requires no experiments
and is somewhat simple to implement. According to Chan and Perry (2017),
a lack of granular data, however, commonly limits the scope of MMM just
to studying the marketing effectiveness on a national level rather than,
for example, regionally or by product category. This limitation reduces
opportunities in detailed decision making and budgeting. MMM also
suffers from various downsides, such as lack of data, untested assumptions

Introduction
of market behaviour and various biases. To counter many of these problems,
Chan and Perry suggest three areas of improvement for MMM:
1. Better data
2. Better models
3. Model validation through simulation

A model that could measure
the underlying performance structure, starting from promotions and other
low-level activities, would facilitate more granular decision making and
possibly have a more significant impact on marketing performance.

Overall, a gap seems to exist
in research for a complete retail marketing mix model that would support
the retailers in decision making on all levels with accurate marketing
performance data.

MMM often suffers from
various downsides, such as lack of data, deficient model forms and biases. Researchers
have consequently suggested improving it through better data, better models and model
validation. However, researchers mainly discuss these areas as a way to improve model
accuracy rather than to widen the scope of analysis. Improving modelling granularity
would enable marketers to analyse performance on lower levels and broaden their discussion on improvements. Higher granularity could particularly support the retail industry,
where marketing is a complex operation because of wide product ranges, geographical
reaches and customer bases

The ROMI compares the returns and costs
of marketing, thus recognising marketing as an investment. A marketing
decision with a positive ROMI can be deemed a justified investment and
one with a negative ROMI unjustified. The measure also helps in comparing marketing decisions by revealing the ones with higher efficiency.
The simple formula, however, leaves a lot open for interpretation. For
example, how should marketers measure the incremental margins? What
spending should be included in the measurement? Overall, Farris et al.
(2015) identify three primary sources of variation in ROMI measurement:

The **incremental returns** may be measured in different ways. A typical
practice is to do a baseline–lift valuation that splits sales into a baseline, which would have been reached without the specific marketing
effort(s), and into an incremental uplift part, which can be attributed
to the marketing effort(s) (Farris et al., 2015). The incremental uplift
part is then used in the calculation of the ROMI. Different modellers
may, however, define the baseline and incremental sales differently. A
common approach (e.g. by Cain (2010)) is to define the baseline as the
long-term or trend component of the sales time series that is driven
by the underlying consumer preferences (i.e. the marketing assets),
regular shelf price, distribution and other underlying factors, and
the incremental sales as the week-to-week sales fluctuation driven
by marketing and promotions.
To derive more accurate results, some models further dissect the
incremental sales. For example, Silva-Risso et al. (1999) divide incremental sales of promotions into ‘borrowed’ and ‘truly incremental’
(see Figure 2.3). The borrowed sales are purchases that consumers
would have done in the future but were accelerated or cannibalised
by stockpiling because of the promotion. Other such side effects, such
as cannibalisation and halo, may also be taken into account.
Besides incremental sales, ROMI measurement can also be based
on cost-savings, conversion rates and changes in customer equity
and marketing assets (Farris et al., 2015). The changes in customer
equity and marketing assets can be used to estimate the long-term
ROMI, although measuring the effects and setting a reliable baseline
may turn out to be difficult (Stewart, 2009).

The **scope of the ROMI measure** can also change. For example, it can
range from measuring the overall marketing impact to the impact of
an individual campaign, promotion, ad or ad view. The measure can
appear under new names when changing the scope, for example, as
return on advertising spending (ROAS) when discussing advertising
spending. Overall, the ROMI can be adapted to support both strategic
and tactical decisions at various levels of the organisation.

The **range of the ROMI** can take three different forms: total, incremental
and marginal. The total ROMI evaluates the return on all spending,
the incremental ROMI the return on a specified spending increment
and the marginal ROMI describes the return gained when increasing
spending with one unit (Farris et al., 2015). These forms can be useful
in different decisions. For example, the total ROMI can be used to
evaluate whether an investment is profitable in general, whereas
the incremental and marginal ROMI figures can be used to evaluate
whether it is worth putting more money into an investment.

Because of all the possible variations, marketers and managers can easily
misinterpret ROMI numbers. Consequently, Farris et al. (2015) recommend
that marketers fully disclose their definition and measurement method
of the ROMI to promote transparency and to support effective decision
making.

Besides just calculating the current ROMI, marketers also often attempt
to estimate the ROMI at other levels of spending. Typically, the estimate
takes the form of an S-curve that is shaped by two inherent characteristics
of media spending: the necessity to have a certain level of awareness
before marketing starts to be effective and the diminishing returns of
media investment (Mantia, 2015; Wang et al., 2017). An example of such
curves is given in Figure 2.4 by Karmann et al. (2015). For each point on
the curves, the total and marginal ROAS are calculable. The definition of
ROAS is slightly different from the ROMI as the advertising spending is
not subtracted from the incremental profit.

When using ROMI figures to make decisions, it is essential to distinguish
effectiveness and efficiency. Effectiveness refers to the ability to reach a
goal, whereas efficiency refers to the ability to do so with the least amount
of resources.
For companies, the goal is to make a profit. Thus, the ROMI measures the
efficiency of marketing efforts rather than their effectiveness. The upper
part of the ROMI equation, in turn, represents effectiveness. Although
improving efficiency, in general, also leads to improving effectiveness,
it may fail in some cases. Imagine two mutually exclusive marketing
projects: the first one returning EUR 100 million for a EUR 50 million
investment and the second one returning EUR 10 million for a EUR 2
million investment. The first one has a higher net return (e50 mill. vs
e8 mill.) but a lower ROMI (100% vs 400%). Thus, the goal in marketing
should be to maximise effectiveness rather than just efficiency, even if it
reduces efficiency (Farris et al., 2015; Hanssens and Pauwels, 2016). One
way to reach this goal is to use incremental ROMI between two choices
(Farris et al., 2015). In our example, we get a 187.5% incremental ROMI
((100 − 10)/(50 − 2) · 100% = 187.5%) when selecting the first project over
the second one.

To reach higher profits, marketers should not blindly shift budgets toward
high ROMI marketing efforts. Low ROMI operations may be saturated
but effective. High ROMI operations may, in some cases, become quickly
saturated, and sudden shifts towards them can lead to lower effectiveness.
Moreover, the ROMI does not, by default, tell about the risks involved investments. Additional investment into an activity that has performed well
in the past can always fail. Thus, marketers should consider marketing
spending as an investment and carefully approach the decisions with the
help relevant information, e.g. ROMI figures, S-curve estimates, forecasts
and risk analyses.
Although the ROMI is a useful measure in marketing decision making,
some researchers criticise it. For example, Ambler and Roberts (2005) and
Rust et al. (2004) note that the ROMI often dismisses the potential impact
of marketing investments on long-term marketing assets, thus yielding
inaccurate results on the profitability of investments. Consequently, they
recommend using other long-term measures alongside the ROMI. Despite
the critique, the ROMI remains a simple and effective way to assess the
short-term impact of investments. Moreover, if a company manages to
quantify the financial impact of long-term effects, it can include them into
the ROMI to form a complete estimate.

Overall, the ROMI can help marketers to gain back the trust of CEOs.

The ROMI can help in answering many marketing questions. For example:
1) How much return do we get from spending X amount on marketing?
2) How should we allocate our marketing budget to maximise our sales?
Because these questions are mainly causal, it makes sense to use commonly accepted methods for studying causality to measure the impact
of marketing and the ROMI. Randomised experiments and the potential
outcomes framework (Imbens and Rubin, 2015) are perhaps the most common ones of these methods and researchers regularly apply them in other
fields. Randomised experiments have also been applied successfully to
measure marketing effectiveness, and their cost has been brought down
by the Internet and digital measurement infrastructures (Lewis and Rao,
2015). Thanks to their effectiveness, they have also become a part of the
innovation process of many businesses, such as Amazon and Microsoft
(Kohavi et al., 2009) and incorporated into advertising tools of Google and
Facebook (Facebook, 2015; Google, 2018). However, they also have several
barriers that prevent their adoption. For example, to reveal the S-curve,
experiments must be done at various levels of advertising spending, which
can be costly. Moreover, the need and cost of having large control groups to
measure weak effects limit the opportunities in their use.

Because of the impracticality of the conventional methods for studying
causality, companies often resort to using more straightforward marketing
mix modelling (MMM), aka media mix modelling, techniques. MMM attempts to model the demand response by fitting a model, typically an OLS
regression with various drivers and control factors, in historical data (Chan
and Perry, 2017). The results commonly include ROAS estimates for advertising channels and a break-down of the effect of different drivers. The
technique is cheap, fast and straightforward to apply as it typically involves
no experimentation. Yet, the validity of the results is often questionable.
The models are often based on inaccurate or unverified assumptions about
the nature of marketing environment (Zhang and Vaver, 2017) and are
merely capable of producing correlational, not causal results (Chan and
Perry, 2017).

MMM typically uses four types of
data to fit their models:
• response data, which are typically volume or sales data,
• media metrics, which are commonly media spending data but sometimes other KPIs such as impressions and clicks,
• marketing metrics such as price, promotions, product distribution,
and
• control factors such as seasonality, weather and market competition.

If suitable data are available, modellers can fit models on various levels
of data aggregation, for example, ranging from the level of an individual
product to the total business unit level, as presented in Figure 2.5 by Cain
(2010).

The lower the level of the fitting, the more detailed conclusions
can be drawn from the results. However, data granularity often limits
the choice. As described by Chan and Perry (2017), companies typically
have granular sales data on SKU or store level but do their advertising
on a higher level over an entire country. As the data types in the model
should preferably be on the same aggregation level, the least granular
data type often sets the granularity of the whole model. Thus, models
are often fitted on the national level using weekly or monthly aggregated
data. Moreover, some of the data types may be difficult to obtain. For
example, companies often omit competitor data, such as marketing efforts
and prices, or ad exposure data, especially for offline media, because of
the difficulty of collecting reliable data. The omission can, in turn, lead to
inaccuracies in modelling. Overall, the lack of (reliable) data is one of the
main limitations of MMM.

 Limitations of marketing mix modelling
As described by Chan and Perry (2017), the results from a regression-based
marketing mix model cannot be claimed to be causal in general, but they
are likely to be more trustworthy when:
• enough data are available to estimate all the parameters in the model,
• useful variability exists in the advertising levels and control variables,
• the model inputs vary independently,
• the model accounts for all the important sales drivers, and
• the model captures the causal relationship between variables.

Despite the importance of these conditions, models often fail to meet them,
limiting not only the reliability of results and but also the scope of the
analysis. Overall, these and many other challenges limit the opportunities
in MMM:
The lack of data limits the reliability of the results and the model granularity. As mentioned in Section 2.3.1, companies typically may have
accurate data on sales but lack granular data on marketing. Low
granularity in one data type can limit the whole model to the same
level, forcing the modeller to aggregate other data types. The aggregation leads to a data set with a low number of data points. For
example, a three-year data set of weekly-aggregated data has only
156 data points. If a company has several advertising channels, each
of which is modelled with several parameters, the number of data
points per parameter in the model can quickly become quite low. The
result might be an unstable regression fit that gives poor estimates
(Chan and Perry, 2017). Many researchers have suggested that the
number of observations should be at least five times the number of
parameters (Leeflang et al., 2015). The lack of data can also lead to
the omission of variables. For example, companies often fail to gather
data about various control activities with a sales impact, such as competitor activity, leading to possible errors because of their omission.

Data reliability is also crucial for the reliability of results. If the modeller feeds inaccurate data to the model, it will only produce inaccurate results. One typical source of inaccuracies is the lack of
systematic data collection. For example, Karmann et al. (2015) note
that it is often a significant challenge for companies to measure their
marketing spending fully. Spending may, for example, become buried
in the budgets of different departments and local subsidiaries and
never become registered in the main marketing department.

A limited range of data creates extrapolation uncertainty when esti19
Measuring marketing effectiveness
mating sales outside the observed budget range (Chan and Perry,
2017). For example, if an advertiser wants to estimate the average
ROAS of an advertising channel, it needs to estimate the level of
sales at zero spending. If no data near zero spending is available,
extrapolation may produce inaccurate results if the S-curve suddenly
changes outside the available range. Thus, a model may produce accurate results for the marginal ROAS but fail to produce reasonable
estimates for the total ROAS.

The lack of model validation and evaluation limits model reliability.
As described by Zhang and Vaver (2017), drawing causal results
from MMM requires making assumptions about the nature of the
marketing environment. Although these assumptions are inevitably
inaccurate to some extent, they also remain unidentified or unverified
in many situations. In some cases, they may also even be unverifiable. The inaccuracies and omissions of assumptions, in turn, reduce
the reliability of the results. Consequently, Zhang and Vaver state
that both observational and experimental methods require careful
evaluation and validation. With observational methods, such as
marketing mix modelling, modellers should attempt to verify the
accuracy of result estimates against a source of truth, for example,
from a simulation experiment.

Correlated input parameters are a typical problem with MMM: advertisers often seek to maximise the impact of marketing efforts by
investing in them in a correlated way. For example, an advertising
channel could be observed at a high level only when a significant
discount is in place or only during a specific season. In a linear
regression model, this correlation can lead to coefficient estimates
with variance and thus, lead to a wrong attribution of sales to the
advertising channel (Chan and Perry, 2017).

Selection bias is a major hurdle for MMM. As described by Chan and
Perry (2017), it occurs when an input media variable correlates with
an unobservable demand parameter that drives sales. When that
parameter is left outside the regression, the model falsely attributes
sales to the media instead of the unobservable parameter. The bias
can be caused, for example, by:
1. Ad targeting – Especially in digital channels, selection bias occurs when ads are shown to people who are already interested in the
product, for example, when showing ads for a related search query.
If the underlying interest remains unaccounted for, it can lead to
false attribution.

2. Seasonality – Unknown or inaccurately modelled seasonality can
lead to selection bias as well. For example, a holiday can cause an
increase in sales that becomes falsely attributed to an advertising
channel. Similarly, competitors’ marketing efforts are not often
accounted for because no data of them are often available.

3. Funnel effects – Selection bias also occurs when the level of one
advertising channel affects the level of another one. For example, a
TV ad might drive more search queries leading to more paid search
ads.

Short-termism is a weakness of MMM as well. Conventional MMM
focuses on measuring short-term incremental sales that will consequently, only provide an estimate of the short-term ROAS. Cain
(2010) repeats the critique by Ambler and Roberts (2005) and Rust
et al. (2004) by stating that this focus disregards the potential brandbuilding and brand-eroding effects of marketing and often leads to a
bias towards promotion activity, where incremental sales are more
immediate than in, for example, media activity. He suggests that to
measure long-term effects, models must also focus on the base sales
component of the model. The base sales reflect the changes in underlying marketing assets, for example, by growing when new customers
convert into loyal customers that make repeated purchases. 

However, according to Cain, the standard OLS regression models are only
capable of imposing a fixed or deterministic baseline that prevents
the analysis of the long-term impact of marketing. Consequently, he
suggests the use of time series regression models to decompose the
sales into short-term (incremental) and long-term base (trend) sales.

Past performance may not be the best indicator for future performance.
Conventional MMM only provides an estimate of the past performance but does not specifically attempt to estimate what the performance will be in the future. Customer behaviour and market
conditions may change in the future and affect marketing performance and S-curves. Thus, the results from MMM should be used
with caution when making decisions.
