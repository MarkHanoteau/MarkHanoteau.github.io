I sometimes fear for Marketing. 

Why does Marketing struggle so much to demonstrate it's financial returns / impact on financial outcomes?

Measuring the impact of marketing is essential for improving its performance and
justifying marketing decisions to top management. However, marketers often struggle
with it. 

To optimise marketing spending and to promote the accountability of
marketing, Stewart (2009) suggests developing industry-wide standardised measures for the short-term and long-term effects. The real options,

however, remain specific to each company and thus are not standardisable
as measures. The measures used for quantifying the short- and long-term
effects should be financial. According to Stewart (2009), this is important because it is the language that top management understands and
by which their performance is evaluated. Financial measures also enable
comparison and benchmarking between different actions. Without such
measures, making both strategic and tactical decisions becomes harder
and less fact-based. 

For example, it would be hard to decide whether to
decrease or increase the marketing budget without knowing whether the
decision would increase or decrease profits. Similarly, it would be challenging to decide on the allocation of the advertising budget between different
media if their effectiveness at different levels of spending is unknown. It
would also be tricky to select the optimal items and their discount rates for
promotion without an estimate of the incremental sales. Overall, financial
measures support decision making on both the strategic and the tactical
level.

To gain back their trust and influence, marketing departments need
to start measuring the impact of marketing – as is done with any other

Introduction
investment. 

From this marketing process, it is possible to identify different types
of returns. Stewart (2009) suggests that marketing has three types of
returns: short-term (incremental) effects, long-term (persistent) effects
and real options (see Figure 2.2)

One of the most commonly applied financial measures is the
return on marketing investment (ROMI) that combines both the returns
and costs of marketing into the equation

ROMI =
Incremental margin − Marketing investment / 
Marketing investment 

(According to Stewart (2009), marketing can be identified to
have three types of impacts: short-term (incremental) returns, e.g. sales,
long-term (persistent) effects, e.g. customer attitudes, and real options,
e.g. a higher price point enabled by a valued brand. )

 The measure enables the comparison
of efficiencies between different marketing investments. It is typically
calculated by doing a baseline-lift valuation on short-term sales, where
the effect of a marketing effort on sales is separated from the level of sales
that would have been reached without the marketing effort. Marketers
can adapt the measure to analyse different investments, for example, to
measure return on advertising spending (ROAS). The measure is criticised
by some researchers (e.g. Ambler and Roberts (2005); Rust et al. (2004))
for often only including short-term effects and disregarding any long-term
effects. Thus, other measures may be needed to support it.
Despite the short-termism of ROMI, researchers and companies have
done a considerable amount of research on the topic. The most commonly
studied and applied method is marketing mix modelling (MMM), aka
media mix modelling, where a regression model is fitted to historical data
to represent sales as a function of advertising and marketing variables,
such as media spend, number of views and product price, and control
variables, such as weather, seasonality, and market competition. The
outputs are typically ROAS figures for media, which can be used to adjust
marketing budgets. The method is popular as it requires no experiments
and is somewhat simple to implement. According to Chan and Perry (2017),
a lack of granular data, however, commonly limits the scope of MMM just
to studying the marketing effectiveness on a national level rather than,
for example, regionally or by product category. This limitation reduces
opportunities in detailed decision making and budgeting. MMM also
suffers from various downsides, such as lack of data, untested assumptions

Introduction
of market behaviour and various biases. To counter many of these problems,
Chan and Perry suggest three areas of improvement for MMM:
1. Better data
2. Better models
3. Model validation through simulation

A model that could measure
the underlying performance structure, starting from promotions and other
low-level activities, would facilitate more granular decision making and
possibly have a more significant impact on marketing performance.

Overall, a gap seems to exist
in research for a complete retail marketing mix model that would support
the retailers in decision making on all levels with accurate marketing
performance data.

MMM often suffers from
various downsides, such as lack of data, deficient model forms and biases. Researchers
have consequently suggested improving it through better data, better models and model
validation. However, researchers mainly discuss these areas as a way to improve model
accuracy rather than to widen the scope of analysis. Improving modelling granularity
would enable marketers to analyse performance on lower levels and broaden their discussion on improvements. Higher granularity could particularly support the retail industry,
where marketing is a complex operation because of wide product ranges, geographical
reaches and customer bases

The ROMI compares the returns and costs
of marketing, thus recognising marketing as an investment. A marketing
decision with a positive ROMI can be deemed a justified investment and
one with a negative ROMI unjustified. The measure also helps in comparing marketing decisions by revealing the ones with higher efficiency.
The simple formula, however, leaves a lot open for interpretation. For
example, how should marketers measure the incremental margins? What
spending should be included in the measurement? Overall, Farris et al.
(2015) identify three primary sources of variation in ROMI measurement:

The **incremental returns** may be measured in different ways. A typical
practice is to do a baseline–lift valuation that splits sales into a baseline, which would have been reached without the specific marketing
effort(s), and into an incremental uplift part, which can be attributed
to the marketing effort(s) (Farris et al., 2015). The incremental uplift
part is then used in the calculation of the ROMI. Different modellers
may, however, define the baseline and incremental sales differently. A
common approach (e.g. by Cain (2010)) is to define the baseline as the
long-term or trend component of the sales time series that is driven
by the underlying consumer preferences (i.e. the marketing assets),
regular shelf price, distribution and other underlying factors, and
the incremental sales as the week-to-week sales fluctuation driven
by marketing and promotions.
To derive more accurate results, some models further dissect the
incremental sales. For example, Silva-Risso et al. (1999) divide incremental sales of promotions into ‘borrowed’ and ‘truly incremental’
(see Figure 2.3). The borrowed sales are purchases that consumers
would have done in the future but were accelerated or cannibalised
by stockpiling because of the promotion. Other such side effects, such
as cannibalisation and halo, may also be taken into account.
Besides incremental sales, ROMI measurement can also be based
on cost-savings, conversion rates and changes in customer equity
and marketing assets (Farris et al., 2015). The changes in customer
equity and marketing assets can be used to estimate the long-term
ROMI, although measuring the effects and setting a reliable baseline
may turn out to be difficult (Stewart, 2009).

The **scope of the ROMI measure** can also change. For example, it can
range from measuring the overall marketing impact to the impact of
an individual campaign, promotion, ad or ad view. The measure can
appear under new names when changing the scope, for example, as
return on advertising spending (ROAS) when discussing advertising
spending. Overall, the ROMI can be adapted to support both strategic
and tactical decisions at various levels of the organisation.

The **range of the ROMI** can take three different forms: total, incremental
and marginal. The total ROMI evaluates the return on all spending,
the incremental ROMI the return on a specified spending increment
and the marginal ROMI describes the return gained when increasing
spending with one unit (Farris et al., 2015). These forms can be useful
in different decisions. For example, the total ROMI can be used to
evaluate whether an investment is profitable in general, whereas
the incremental and marginal ROMI figures can be used to evaluate
whether it is worth putting more money into an investment.

Because of all the possible variations, marketers and managers can easily
misinterpret ROMI numbers. Consequently, Farris et al. (2015) recommend
that marketers fully disclose their definition and measurement method
of the ROMI to promote transparency and to support effective decision
making.
