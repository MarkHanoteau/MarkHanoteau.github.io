What is Scrum about anyway?

Learn about Scrum and its benefits. This article allows you to chose whether to be exposed to jargon.. or not!

This post will be divided into 3 sequences. The first passage will focus on the value of scrum without using any of the terminology. The second adds framework guidelines to allow for a more fundamental understanding of Scrum. The final paragraph sprints through my recommendation on how to assimilate Scrum concepts in the most intuitive, comprehensive and enjoyable manner. 

**Understanding Scrum - Step 1: Focus on Value.**

Imagine
> being clear about your and your team's purpose in an environment where bottom up thinking is the norm.  
> everyone collaborating as a cohesive unit towards a clearly defined, common and valuable business outcome.  
> having this shared vision broken down into an intermediate goal. This objective is within your realistic capabilities to accomplish in a short duration.
> 
> being confident that the output of your current work is the most valuable milestone you can produce within your scope of work.
>  
> the feeling of each milestone being a step closer towards achieving your business outcome as it builds on previous outputs.
> 
> feeling empowered by frequent guidance and validation from peers, customers and stakeholders as you progress through your work. 
> 
> being able to pivot your work and respond to this feedback in iterative and innovative measures, mitigating risk along the way. 

The essence of Scrum, driven by the Agile principles, is to generate value. 

**Understanding Scrum - Step 2: Now letÂ´s add Scrum concepts.**

Allow yourself not to think about Scrum for the length of the paragraph. Move away from its rules, roles, meetings and commitments. Think differently. Instead, focus on the value it generates.
