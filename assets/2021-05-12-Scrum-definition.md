LinkedIn Post:

What is Scrum about anyway?

Learn about Scrum and its benefits. 

This post will be divided into 3 sequences. The first passage will focus on the value of scrum without using any of the terminology. The second adds framework guidelines (check if it's finally framework guidelines) that allow for a more fundamental understanding of Scrum. The final paragraph sprints through my recommendation on how to assimilate Scrum concepts in the most intuitive, comprehensive and enjoyable manner. 

**Understanding Scrum - Step 1: What's the difference between Scrum and Agile?.**

Agile is about increasing the value of the work coming out of your organization. Employee engagement also rises. 

Would you rather having to project manage your team and being the only thinker in the room 

OR

 walking in to a meeting with your team, sitting down and people self organizing and collaborating towards solutioning work problems. 
 
 Whatever the industry, the variety and complexity of your work, empowering your employees to autonomosly think through solutions is the single best method of innovating your
 company through to the best possible value offering it can provide. 
 
Distance from Project Management: DisclaimerÃ‘ Scrum and Agile may requires a change in behavior and approach. It is important to make clear and obvious the Agile because if you focus on doing Scrum by the book without adhering to these principles, you will create problems. People won{t find their groove, things won't click, outputs will have quality issues.  If you don{t do this, you might 'fake' scrum and adding your own project management twist to it.

Stop from doing agile and start being agile.
 
 Learning loops 
 
 Design principles that underpin work.

**Understanding Scrum - Step 2: Focus on Value.**

Scrum is an Agile framework that helps you think differently and craft your work with a focus on the value it generates. 

Imagine..

> .. having utmost clarity about your and your team's purpose  
> .. collaborating as a cohesive unit with your team towards a clearly defined, common and valuable business outcome  
> .. cooperating to break this shared vision down into realistic and prioritized milestones  
> .. picking one milestone at a time and accomplishing it within a short duration  
> .. being confident that your current work output adds the most possible value to the desired outcome  
> .. moving ever closer towards achieving your business outcome as it builds on previous outputs  
> .. obtaining cyclical guidance and validation from peers, customers and stakeholders    
> .. pivoting your work accordingly in iterative and innovative measures, mitigating risk along the way
> .. and doing all of this under the minimal amount of meetings required

The essence of Scrum, driven by the Agile principles, is to iteratively self improve in order to generate market value. 

**Understanding Scrum - Step 3: Steps towards applying Scrum**

Now that you know the value, here's a snapshot of how scrum is applied: 

The next paragraph is aimed at those who are interested in implementing the above value benefits within their teams. 

First step is to **be** Agile in terms of mindset and culture. In order to do this, refer to the Agile manifesto to read the 4 values and then refer to the 12 principles.  It is important you really internalize these concepts and start correcting any behaviors within your organizations that don't align with these. 

Second step is to **do** work following Agile rituals. Multiple practices can be applied, but if passage 2 was alluring to you, I suggest you learn Scrum. This infographic is a quick and gentle initiation to Scrum's rules, roles, meetings and commitments.
