LinkedIn Post:

What is Scrum about anyway?

Learn about Scrum and its benefits. 

Scrum qualifies as the prime oxymoron. It is a surprisingly easy framework to understand yet its concepts can be difficult to put in practice. This post lists three steps that ensure organizations that wish to embrace Scrum do so correctly. 

**Understand how to BE Agile**

[David Marquet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqmdLcyES_Q)'s definition of leadership is one I like to promote within my teams: "*embedding the capacity for greatness in the people and practices in the people and practices of an organization, and decoupling it from the personality of the leader*".

A prime enabler of this mindset is Agile. Agile is a set of [4 values](https://agilemanifesto.org/) and [12 principles](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) that invariably nurtures collaboration, empowers people to be self directed and focuses on increasing the value of the work that comes out of an organization. 

It may take deliberation to detach oneself from habits and think differently about how to craft work with a focus on the value it generates. I recommend you take the time to read through and internalize these Agile concepts as they will help you correct any behaviors within your organizations that don't aligh with your desired ways of working.

**Understand how to BE Agile through Scrum**

Now you understand the required Agile behaviors, let's move on to how you can help people find their groove. This is where Scrum not only connects with, but is supposed to synergize, Agile. is a framework within which we can apply those values and principles. 



Distance from Project Management: Disclaimer Scrum and Agile may requires a change in behavior and approach. It is important to make clear and obvious the Agile because if you focus on doing Scrum by the book without adhering to these principles, you will create problems. People won{t find their groove, things won't click, outputs will have quality issues.  If you don{t do this, you might 'fake' scrum and adding your own project management twist to it. 

Measure the success of how Agile we are by adherence to Scrum events and rules as opposed to: are we getting the outcome that we want from having undertaken Scrum? 

Imagine..

> .. having utmost clarity about your and your team's purpose  
> .. collaborating as a cohesive unit with your team towards a clearly defined, common and valuable business outcome  
> .. cooperating to break this shared vision down into realistic and prioritized milestones  
> .. picking one milestone at a time and accomplishing it within a short duration  
> .. being confident that your current work output adds the most possible value to the desired outcome  
> .. moving ever closer towards achieving your business outcome as it builds on previous outputs  
> .. obtaining cyclical guidance and validation from peers, customers and stakeholders    
> .. pivoting your work accordingly in iterative and innovative measures, mitigating risk along the way
> .. and doing all of this under the minimal amount of meetings required

The essence of Scrum, driven by the Agile principles, is to iteratively self improve in order to generate market value. 

**Understand how to DO Agile work by applying Scrum**

The next paragraph is aimed at those who are interested in implementing the above value benefits within their teams. 

Second step is to **do** work following Agile rituals. Multiple practices can be applied, but if passage 2 was alluring to you, I suggest you learn Scrum. This [infographic](https://www.knowledgehut.com/blog/agile/infographic-scrum-process-in-a-nutshell) is a quick and gentle snapshot initiation to Scrum's rules, roles, meetings and commitments.

If you're looking for an intuitive yet comprehensive introduction on how to apply Scrum, [Valentin Despa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vdespa/) provides two Udemy courses that, should you trust and follow Valentin's guidance, are the perfect preparation to become either a certified [Scrum Master](https://www.udemy.com/course/scrum-master-certification-preparation-mock-exam-questions-psm-i/) or a certified [Product Owner](https://www.udemy.com/course/scrum-product-owner-certification-prep-mock-exam-questions/) should you want to pay for Scrum.org's respective Level 1 assessments. 


Footnote: Congratulations! You have just done scrum.

These three paragraphs should be read as 'Sprints': concise passages that should be read in sequential order and not skipped until fully comprehended. 

This post will be divided into 3 sequences. The first passage will focus on the value of scrum without using any of the terminology. The second adds framework guidelines (check if it's finally framework guidelines) that allow for a more fundamental understanding of Scrum. The final paragraph sprints through my recommendation on how to assimilate Scrum concepts in the most intuitive, comprehensive and enjoyable manner.
