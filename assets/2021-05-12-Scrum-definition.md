LinkedIn Post:

What is Scrum about anyway?

Learn about Scrum and its benefits. This article allows you to chose whether to be exposed to jargon.. or not!

This post will be divided into 3 sequences. The first passage will focus on the value of scrum without using any of the terminology. The second adds framework guidelines (check if it's finally framework guidelines) that allow for a more fundamental understanding of Scrum. The final paragraph sprints through my recommendation on how to assimilate Scrum concepts in the most intuitive, comprehensive and enjoyable manner. 

**Understanding Scrum - Step 1: Focus on Value.**

Imagine..

> .. having utmost clarity about your and your team's purpose  
> .. collaborating as a cohesive unit with your team towards a clearly defined, common and valuable business outcome  
> .. cooperating to break this shared vision down into realistic and prioritized milestones  
> .. picking one milestone at a time and accomplishing it within a short duration  
> .. being confident that your current work output adds the most possible value to the desired outcome  
> .. moving ever closer towards achieving your business outcome as it builds on previous outputs  
> .. obtaining cyclical guidance and validation from peers, customers and stakeholders    
> .. pivoting your work accordingly in iterative and innovative measures, mitigating risk along the way

The essence of Scrum, driven by the Agile principles, is to generate value. 

**Understanding Scrum - Step 2: Now letÂ´s add Scrum concepts.**

Allow yourself not to think about Scrum for the length of the paragraph. Move away from its rules, roles, meetings and commitments. Think differently. Instead, focus on the value it generates.
